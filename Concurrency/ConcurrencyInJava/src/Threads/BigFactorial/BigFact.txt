/* Big Factorial (Assignment)

Problem Statement -

Implement a thread that computes factorials of a large number. 
Since the result can be significantly large, you should use the BigInteger class to store the result and perform the computation.
Instructions -
Implement the BigFactorial Class: Design this class to utilize multi-threading for computing the factorial of large numbers, 
specifically by extending the Thread class. Incorporate the BigInteger class for handling large results. 

Detailed requirements for the class include:

   1. An int field to hold the number for factorial computation.
   2. A BigInteger field to store the computed factorial.
   3. A constructor to initialize the class with the target number.
   4. Essential methods to perform the computation in a separate thread and retrieve the result.
   5. The class should override the run() method of the Thread class to perform the factorial computation within a separate thread.

The class should efficiently calculate the factorial of any number provided, ensuring thread-safe execution and resource management, 
by extending the Thread class and overriding the run() method.
