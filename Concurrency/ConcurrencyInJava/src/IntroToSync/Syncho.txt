-Synchronization in Concurrent Programming:

Introduction to Synchronization Problems

The primary issue in concurrent programming is managing access to shared resources or data.
The class focuses on understanding synchronization problems that occur when multiple threads access shared data:

    Critical Section: A segment of code where shared resources are accessed .
    Race Condition: Occurs when multiple threads compete for the same resources leading to unpredictable results .
    Preemption: Happens when a thread in a critical section is interrupted, causing synchronization issues .

Solutions to Synchronization Problems

Java provides several mechanisms to address synchronization problems in multi-threaded applications:
Synchronized Methods and Blocks

    Synchronized Block: Ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code that manipulates shared data at a time .
    Synchronized Method: Only one thread can access a synchronized method of an object at a time .

Locks and Mutex

    Mutex (Mutual Exclusion): Uses locks to prevent multiple threads from entering the critical section simultaneously .

Semaphores

    Introduced to handle more complex scenarios like the producer-consumer problem. Semaphores allow multiple threads to access limited resources .
        Producer-Consumer Problem: This problem illustrates the need for synchronization. Using semaphores, 
        producers and consumers alternate access to a buffer, ensuring data integrity .

Concurrent Collections

    Java provides concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap that manage synchronization internally, allowing threads to access without additional locks .

Practical Implementation and Homework
Practical Example

A typical setup involves:

    Producer: Adds items to the store.
    Consumer: Removes items from the store.
    Using semaphores to control access based on resource availability .

Implementation in Java

    Semaphore Implementation:

    Semaphore producerSemaphore = new Semaphore(5); // Allow up to 5 producer threads
    Semaphore consumerSemaphore = new Semaphore(0); // Consumers wait until there is something to consume

    Producer Threads:

    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        Producer producer = new Producer(store, producerSemaphore, consumerSemaphore);
        new Thread(producer).start();
    }

    Consumer Threads:

    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        Consumer consumer = new Consumer(store, producerSemaphore, consumerSemaphore);
        new Thread(consumer).start();
    }

Homework

    Simulate and reason out how semaphores control access and manage the execution flow among producers and consumers .
    Explore using synchronized methods for static methods and understand the concepts of class-level and object-level locking .

Conclusion

Understanding and correctly implementing synchronization is vital in multi-threaded programming to avoid issues like race conditions and ensure data integrity when accessing shared resources.
