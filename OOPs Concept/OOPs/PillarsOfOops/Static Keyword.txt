Q. what is static and why use ?

The static keyword is used in many programming languages (like Java, C#, and C++) to define members (variables, methods, blocks, or nested classes) that belong to the class rather than any specific instance of the class.
Here's a breakdown of what it means and why it's useful:

What is the static keyword?

Class-Level Association:

When a member is declared as static, it is associated with the class itself, not with any object of the class.
This means you can access it without creating an instance of the class.

Shared Across All Instances:

A static member is shared among all instances of the class. If one instance modifies a static variable, the change is reflected across all instances.
Memory Management:

Static members are loaded into memory once when the class is loaded, making them efficient for shared data or utility methods.
Why use the static keyword?
Utility Methods:

Methods that don't depend on instance variables can be made static.
For example, Math utility methods like Math.sqrt() in Java are static because they don't require an object to perform their operations.
Shared Data:

Use static variables for data that should be shared across all instances of a class, like a counter or configuration settings.
Global Access:

Static members can be accessed globally using the class name, making them useful for constants or global configurations.
Memory Efficiency:

Since static members are loaded once, they save memory when used for shared data or methods.

Key Points to Remember-

Static Variables: Shared across all instances of the class.
Static Methods: Can only access other static members (variables or methods) directly.
Static Blocks: Used for static initialization (executed when the class is loaded).
Static Classes: Nested classes can be declared static to make them independent of the outer class
