what is shallow copy?

A shallow copy is a copy of an object where only the references to the elements are copied, not the elements themselves. This means that if the original object contains references to other objects, the shallow copy will reference the same objects, not new copies of them.

Explanation with Your Code
In your code, you create a shallow copy of the originalList using the clone() method:

ArrayList<String> shallowCopy = (ArrayList<String>) originalList.clone();

Here’s what happens:

The shallowCopy list gets a new reference, but it points to the same elements as originalList.
If you modify the structure of originalList (e.g., add or remove elements), it won't affect shallowCopy because they are separate lists.
However, if the elements themselves are mutable objects (e.g., custom objects), changes to those objects will be reflected in both lists because they share the same references.
Why Use a Shallow Copy?
Performance: Shallow copying is faster than deep copying because it doesn’t duplicate the objects being referenced.
Simplicity: It’s easier to implement when you don’t need to modify the objects being referenced.
Use Case: It’s useful when you want to create a new collection or object but still share the same underlying data.
Example Output of Your Code
When you modify the originalList by setting the first element to "Z", the shallowCopy remains unaffected because the elements in the list are strings (immutable objects). The output will be:

If the elements were mutable objects, changes to those objects would appear in both lists.

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ShallowCopyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> originalList = new ArrayList<>();
        originalList.add("A");
        originalList.add("B");

        // Shallow copy
        ArrayList<String> shallowCopy = (ArrayList<String>) originalList.clone();

        // Modifying the original list
        originalList.set(0, "Z");

        System.out.println("Original List: " + originalList);
        System.out.println("Shallow Copy: " + shallowCopy);
    }
}

What is deep copy?

-A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects it references. Unlike a shallow copy, 
which only copies the top-level structure and references the same underlying data, a deep copy ensures that changes to the original object or its nested objects do not affect the copied object.

Why Use a Deep Copy?

Independent Copies: If you need two completely independent objects, a deep copy is essential. Changes to one object won't affect the other.
Avoid Side Effects: When working with mutable objects (e.g., lists, maps, or custom objects), 
a shallow copy can lead to unintended side effects because both objects share references to the same nested data.
Data Integrity: In scenarios where data consistency is critical, deep copying ensures that the copied object is a true replica of the original.
Example of Deep Copy in Java
Here’s how you can implement a deep copy using serialization or by manually copying nested objects:

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class DeepCopyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> originalList = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<String> innerList = new ArrayList<>();
        innerList.add("A");
        innerList.add("B");
        originalList.add(innerList);

        // Deep copy
        ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> deepCopy = new ArrayList<>();
        for (ArrayList<String> list : originalList) {
            deepCopy.add(new ArrayList<>(list)); // Create a new list for each nested list
        }

        // Modifying the original list
        originalList.get(0).set(0, "Z");

        System.out.println("Original List: " + originalList);
        System.out.println("Deep Copy: " + deepCopy);
    }
}

Output:
Key Takeaways:
Use a shallow copy when the data structure is simple or contains immutable objects.
Use a deep copy when working with complex, nested, or mutable objects to avoid shared references.
