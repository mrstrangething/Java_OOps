// Define an interface
interface Animal {
    void eat(); // Abstract method declared
    void sleep(); // Abstract method declared
}

// Implement the interface in a class
class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog is sleeping.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();
        myDog.sleep();
    }
}

** To achieve multiple level inheritance and Abstraction we use Interfaces.

What is interface?

Interfaces - it a set of abstract method you would want your class to implement. these method are public and abstract by default.
don't need to explicitly use keyword abstract. any class implementing interface will needs to provide implementation of those method.
To declare and use interface use -implements- keyword and interface for class
